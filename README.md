# succulusv2

PRAISE OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR, THE LORD SUCCULUS!  PRAISE HIM!

This is version 2 of the Succulus Project.  Last year, a Carlhacks group built a web-based game centered around a vacuum that chases the Carleton College computer science professors around and tries to vacuum them up.  This year, we used pygame!  The interace is a bit better, and the game runs smoother, thus it is version 2.  It was written in python 3, but is back-compatible with python 2.  Simply download python and the appropriate pygame installer (be cared with the x32 vs x64 bit difference), and then run the game!
